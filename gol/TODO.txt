Change all ints to something cheaper for performance reasons.
You can scatter all first row and first col - probably cheaper than sending one by one.

Free memory after performing communication.
Maybe we don't need for loop to initialize.

Ask about computation - e.g that only one core should initialize all variables etc.
Should root processor send all data to itself? will it actually send, how is this organised

2*2 bug kako god okrenes.

Ask about 2*2 bug - call serial version?
Does processor need to wait for sending request to finish.
